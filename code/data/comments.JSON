As an aside, it could be said that many of the adverse effects of culture shock are due to the inability to communicate. A situation may simply be uncomfortable or strange (culture shock) because one can't ask others or understand what's going on. Cultural misunderstandings can be perpetuated simply because either party can't explain sufficiently to diffuse it or language nuances are misinterpreted as offence etc.",

Hopefully my friend won't mind record sentences a few times as I figure out what works best. I also think it weird that I translate each word in \"yo no lo creo\" to English. This is not what we do in our native language. This is why I'm inclined, to start with, in favour of sentences which can be associated with an image as it seems more nature to connect meanings to pictures rather than to words in my native language.",

Certainly interesting project, I wish I had time to pursue that, but alas for next few years I will not have time. Contact Anki developers, someone might do it, and cheaply, with some luck. But adding new data and starting deck from scratch, with no learning history, is not that big deal. Just honestly answer \"easy\" and after few iterations entries are spaced again widely for repetitions.",

I'm really into manga but I only have English volumes of My Hero Academia and Fullmetal Alchemist (though sometimes there is Japanese on signs, packaging, etc.) Is there any manga you would recccemend that's easy to read in Japanese (and when would I go about starting that)? As I'm more of a manga person, usually I only watch anime movies, but I make sure to turn the subs on rather than dubs. Are there any interesting YouTube podcasts that I could watch in Japanese that have short episodes (less than 10 minutes)?",

Instead, she used the local language (the target language) in a very simple and demonstrative fashion (e.g. using gestures, props, careful enunciation, etc.).

        "Text": "If you're learning from context, then I don't see why you necessarily need a list. For material on paper/ebooks, using a highlighter pen or highlight command will be enough. Efficiency is a balancing act, though. In theory, the more you highlight, the more you are learning, however, if it's too difficult, then it won't stick together well in your mind. On the other hand, if the material is too easy (i.e. no words are unfamiliar), then you're not really expanding your vocabulary, either. The highlighting-pen method has the advantage that you can easily review the words (in context) later.",

        "Text": "There are many types of dictionaries. For your situation you may want to look into a \"learner's dictionary\", or \"ESL dictionary\", \"beginner's dictionary\" or similar nomenclature. Rather than focus on \"number of words\", it'd probably be more useful if you read a few few random definitions for words that you already know, and see if you can understand the description of that word. If you can't understand what the definition means for words that you already know, then I suppose you'd also have a hard time figuring out what the definitions of unknown words are trying to say.",

        "Text": "I am not sure that memorizing non-existent words is useful at all. It sounds like those researchers don't know how learning a language and memory work together. Also, memorizing individual words is a hazardous venture in and of itself. Can you cite at least one of those studies so we can read it? I personally don't see how \"anedectal evidence\" re learning non-existent words can be of any use in language learning research.  What would be the *point* of the research?",
