I might hope that an answer could clarify what a given study said with relation to \"similar languages.\" Maybe study(ies) will shed meaningful light on this aspect?",

A situation may simply be uncomfortable or strange (culture shock) because one can't ask others or understand what's going on. Cultural misunderstandings can be perpetuated simply because either party can't explain sufficiently to diffuse it or language nuances are misinterpreted as offence etc.",

Hopefully my friend won't mind record sentences a few times as I figure out what works best. I also think it weird that I translate each word in \"yo no lo creo\" to English. This is not what we do in our native language. This is why I'm inclined, to start with, in favour of sentences which can be associated with an image as it seems more nature to connect meanings to pictures rather than to words in my native language.",

I'm really into manga but I only have English volumes of My Hero Academia and Fullmetal Alchemist (though sometimes there is Japanese on signs, packaging, etc.) Is there any manga you would recccemend that's easy to read in Japanese (and when would I go about starting that)? As I'm more of a manga person, usually I only watch anime movies, but I make sure to turn the subs on rather than dubs. Are there any interesting YouTube podcasts that I could watch in Japanese that have short episodes (less than 10 minutes)?",

Efficiency is a balancing act, though. In theory, the more you highlight, the more you are learning, however, if it's too difficult, then it won't stick together well in your mind. On the other hand, if the material is too easy (i.e. no words are unfamiliar), then you're not really expanding your vocabulary, either. The highlighting-pen method has the advantage that you can easily review the words (in context) later.",

For your situation you may want to look into a \"learner's dictionary\", or \"ESL dictionary\", \"beginner's dictionary\" or similar nomenclature. Rather than focus on \"number of words\", it'd probably be more useful if you read a few few random definitions for words that you already know, and see if you can understand the description of that word. If you can't understand what the definition means for words that you already know, then I suppose you'd also have a hard time figuring out what the definitions of unknown words are trying to say.",

Also, memorizing individual words is a hazardous venture in and of itself. Can you cite at least one of those studies so we can read it? I personally don't see how \"anedectal evidence\" re learning non-existent words can be of any use in language learning research.  What would be the *point* of the research?",
